## Tools and Technologies
- *Excel* – for exploratory data analysis.
- *Power BI* – for dashboard design.   


## Problem Statement
Mpox has re-emerged as a major public health challenge, particularly in underserved communities where weak infrastructure, poor disease surveillance, limited healthcare workforce, and restricted vaccine access hinder effective outbreak response.

These gaps highlight the urgent need for *data-driven decision-making* to improve:
- Outbreak detection and response time  
- Vaccine deployment strategies  
- Case tracking and reporting accuracy  
- Resource allocation for diagnostics and community response  

*Success Metrics:*  
Improved vaccination coverage, earlier outbreak detection, lower case fatality rates, and strengthened community resilience.  
*The cost of inaction is far greater than the investment required today.*



##  Key Insights

### 1. Geographic and Genetic Distribution
- *Clade I* dominates in *Burundi* and *Uganda*, making them the epicenters of the most severe outbreaks.  
- *Clade II* is more prevalent in *Sierra Leone*, contributing to cases but with lower severity.  
- Geographic mapping shows *Burundi, Uganda, and Sierra Leone* as the major hotspots with disproportionately high case counts requiring urgent global attention.

### 2. Surveillance and Laboratory Capacity
- Hotspot countries exhibit *weak surveillance infrastructure* relative to their outbreak burden.  
- *Laboratory-to-case ratios* reveal severe diagnostic gaps: Burundi, Uganda, and Sierra Leone report thousands of cases per testing laboratory, resulting in under-diagnosis and delayed confirmation.  

### 3. Vaccination and Workforce Distribution
- *Vaccine deployment* is significantly lower in hotspot countries compared to those with smaller outbreaks.  
- *Healthcare workforce per 100 cases* is critically low in Burundi, Uganda, and Sierra Leone, causing overburdened response teams and delayed interventions.



##  Recommendations for Future Action
Prioritize high burden countries and maintain the health systems of other countries by:

### 1. Reallocation and Expansion of Surveillance Sites
- *Action:* Scale up surveillance sites to between *500–700* sites across hotspot countries.  
- *Rationale:* Burundi currently operates 357 sites for 37,140 confirmed cases (~104 cases per site).  
- *Impact:* Expected to increase early case detection by *40–96%*, improve reporting speed, and strengthen contact tracing.

### 2. Strengthen Diagnostic Capacity
- *Action:* Increase testing laboratories to *200–500* per country, reducing the ratio of cases per lab from hundreds to under 100.  
- *Example:* Burundi currently has 51 labs for 37,140 confirmed cases (~728 cases per lab).  
- *Impact:* Estimated *74–89% reduction in diagnostic delays*, faster isolation, and more timely treatment.

### 3. Expand the Frontline Workforce
- *Action:* Recruit and train more community health workers to improve vaccination coverage and case reporting.  
- *Impact:* Increased vaccine uptake and earlier identification of community-level outbreaks.




##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates the critical importance of *data-driven public health planning* in combating Mpox outbreaks.  
By leveraging analytics and visualization, targeted interventions can be designed to optimize surveillance, testing, and vaccination — particularly in resource-limited settings.

*Strategic Priorities:*  
1. Immediate: Scale up surveillance and diagnostics in hotspots.  
2. Short-Term: Strengthen vaccination delivery and workforce deployment.  
3. Long-Term: Build resilient health systems and data infrastructure for sustainable outbreak prevention.
